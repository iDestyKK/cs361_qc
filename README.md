# cs361\_qc (Fall 2016)

This is a collection of my assignments from "Operating Systems" (CS361) at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, taught by Qing "Charles" Cao. This class is different from previous CS361 courses in the fact that it has programming assignments as opposed to theory.

Each project directory has their own README.md file. Feel free to check those out for details on what the assignments were. Some projects consisted of multiple programs/parts.
