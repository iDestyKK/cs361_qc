You will write a program with four threads, structured like:

Reader -> Processing Step 1 -> Processing Step 2 -> Writer

The Reader thread will read an input file, one line at a time. Reader will take the each line of the input and pass it to thread PS1 through a buffer of lines. PS1 will scan the line and replace each blank character with an asterisk ("*") character. It will then pass the line to thread PS2 through another buffer of lines. PS2 will scan the line and convert all lower case characters to upper case (e.g., convert "a" to "A"). It will then pass the line to thread Writer through yet another quote of messages. Writer will write the line to an output file.
